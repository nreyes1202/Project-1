## About this project

This project is all on one html page.  At the top of the page is a form that the person can fill out about their To Do Item. Options to fill out are the To Do item its self, the Category the item fits into, the Color of the To Do Item, the Level of importance of the To Do item.  And the Due Date of the Item.  AFter clicking the Add To Do button the person sees an princess Avatar that can level up to higher levels in future versions. Also displayed in glitter is the score the person earns as they add in more items.  Towards the bottom is the list of to Do list items and all their atributes.  At the bottom of the page are the different levels the princess Avatar can level through.

## Details of App and Challenges

We wanted the score to adjust based on the dificulty of the task being completed, but the logic would have been more complicated then what we were ready for when creating this app.

In future versions it would be nice if the To Do items could sort by different Atributes.

The app records the color the person selects, but at this point it does not change the color of the font on the To Do Item.

We wanted items that were completed to move to a done part of the APP but this logic ended up being more complicated then we were ready for when making this project.
